The add-on is supported by over forty filter subscriptions in dozens of languages which automatically configure it for purposes ranging from removing online advertising to blocking all known malware domains. Adblock Plus also allows you to customize your filters with the assistance of a variety of useful features, including a context option for images, a block tab for Flash and Java objects, and a list of blockable items to remove scripts and stylesheets.\n\nStarting with Adblock Plus 2.0 there is an option in Filter Preferences to allow some non-intrusive advertising.

You can either translate the selected text, this way the translated text will overwrite the original selected text, or you can translate the full page too.","fullDescription":"By default, the add-on will try to set your detected language for the default target language. If it is not possible then English will be the target language of the translation.\n\nIt's highly recommended to select less text than more, otherwise the translation will take longer to appear. You can select a maximum of 1100-character long text. If you select a longer text, you'll get an alert box in some cases. You shouldn't either select pictures or tables because these will disappear and mystic text will appear there.\n\nNow, let's see, how it works. Firstly, you search something that you don't understand because it's in an other language. Secondly, you select this section or sentence. Now you can go three ways:\n- Right-click with the mouse and click on \"Translate this text with Google Translate\" text.\n- Click on the Toolbar icon.\n- Press the hot-key.\nAs soon as the translation-progress starts, the Red T will become green, and as soon as the translation ends, it'd be red again. Within a second or two, you'll see that the selection disappears and a text in your language appears there. That's all.\n\nOr, if you want to translate the full page, you can go with the three ways mentioned above, too.\n\nOptions:\nyou can find this menu if you:\n- right-click on the Red T (or before Firefox 57 click on the little arrow next to it) and click \"Options\"\n- go to Add-ons menu and click on configuration of this addon\nyou can set here:\n- what language you want to translate to\n- what (and how) to translate when you click on the Red T or press the hot-key\n- the Hot-key (only before FF57)\nAvailable target languages: you can translate to every language that you can find on Google Translate page (http://translate.google.com/). If you found a language that isn't in the list of this addon then comment here below.\n\nThe language of the original text is automatically detected.\n\nAvailable user interface languages: Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish (Spain), Turkish.\n\n\nThe translations are powered by Google Translate, the addon uses their translator-program.","weeklyDownloads":29510,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"nobzol","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4972254/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/62/62329.png?modified=1543519962","width":529,"height":252,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/62/62329.png?modified=1543519962","thumbnailWidth":529,"thumbnailHeight":252,"caption":"Translating the selected text: select, right-click, click 'Translate this text with Google Translate'"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/62/62330.png?modified=1543519963","width":521,"height":289,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/62/62330.png?modified=1543519963","thumbnailWidth":521,"thumbnailHeight":289,"caption":"Translating the full page: right-click on the page, click 'Translate this page with Google Translate'"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/62/62331.png?modified=1543519964","width":402,"height":323,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/62/62331.png?modified=1543519964","thumbnailWidth":402,"thumbnailHeight":323,"caption":"The Options dialog."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/61/61011.png?modified=1543519965","width":354,"height":121,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/61/61011.png?modified=1543519965","thumbnailWidth":354,"thumbnailHeight":121,"caption":"The default position of the Toolbar button on Firefox4+ versions."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.5789,"reviewCount":776,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-translator-for-firefox/reviews/","updateDate":1543751106000},{"id":"fr-dicollecte@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/354/354872-32.png?modified=1548510843","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/354/354872-64.png?modified=1548510843","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/354/354872-128.png?modified=1548510843"},"name":"French spelling dictionary","version":"6.3.1webext","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1163947/french_spelling_dictionary-6.3.1webext.xpi?src=","size":336423,"homepageURL":"https://grammalecte.net","supportURL":null,"description":"Spelling dictionary for the French language.","fullDescription":"This extension now contains only one spelling dictionary.\n\nFor a better support of the French language, install Grammalecte, the grammar checker.","weeklyDownloads":5566,"type":"dictionary","creator":{"name":"OR","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/4845174/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/146/146492.png?modified=1543520067","width":700,"height":481,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/146/146492.png?modified=1543520067","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":440}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.2288,"reviewCount":33,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dictionnaire-fran%C3%A7ais1/reviews/","updateDate":1543433830000},{"id":"chrome-gnome-shell@gnome.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/751/751081-32.png?modified=1521616823","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/751/751081-64.png?modified=1521616823","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/751/751081-128.png?modified=1521616823"},"name":"GNOME Shell integration","version":"10.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/898030/gnome_shell_integration-10.1-an+fx-linux.xpi?src=","size":209003,"homepageURL":"https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShellIntegrationForChrome","supportURL":"https://bugzilla.gnome.org","description":"This extension provides integration with GNOME Shell and the corresponding extensions repository https://extensions.gnome.org","fullDescription":"You MUST install native connector for this extension to work.\n\nFor Arch Linux there is a PKGBUILD available in the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chrome-gnome-shell-git\n\nFor Debian, Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu you can install package named \"chrome-gnome-shell\".\n\nYou also can install connector manually.

Since Oxford says some words are valid both ways, I kept both and the user decides which he prefers. A good example is: \"online\" and \"on-line\".\nFor ize/ise, both ways are accepted in some words:\n— optimize/optimise: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/optimize;\n— realize/realise: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/realize.\nOxford Dictionaries will only refer that certain words accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts.\nThe regular user won't know by accessing the Oxford site, but I have access to it.\n\nPlaces from New Zealand/UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland):\nOn V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.\nMy scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for \"towns\", \"counties\", \"villages\", \"boroughs\", \"suburbs\", etc. and based me on:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_in_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes.\nAlso, added places sent to me by Peter C.:\n© OpenStreetMap contributors: www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.\n© The Clergy of the Church of England Database Project, 2005.\n\nCities from Australia\nOn V2.65 I added the cities in Australia by population, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population.\n\nCities from US\nOn V2.65 I added tons of cities in the US with a 10 000+ population, since they are in valid English.\nThis list was supplied by Michael Holroyd on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\n\nCities from Canada\nOn V2.67 I added the cities in Canada, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Canada.\n\nCommon prescription and OTC drugs\nOn V2.63 I added tons of drugs names supplied by Andrew Ziem on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\nThe generic drugs (such as \"diphenhydramine\") are in lowercase, while the brand names (such as \"Abilify\") are capitalised.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis. If it is on the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nIt doesn't matter your religion, sex, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally for free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are the correct ones, I have been looking for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015 I purchased an \"Oxford Gold Account\" to have a higher access in Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nI am also involved on several projects with a specific jargon having added some \"special\" words.\n\nI am adding the words with copy/paste after checking them in the dictionaries mentioned above.

LanguageTool finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect, like mixing up there/their, a/an, or repeating a word, and it can detect some grammar problems. It supports more than 25 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Polish, and Russian.\n\nLanguageTool checks the spelling and grammar of almost any text you type on the web. It is compatible with almost all text, regardless of source, including social networks such as Twitter or LinkedIn and online e-mail services, such as Gmail. Very few sites like docs.google.com, addons.mozilla.org, and chrome.google.com currently aren't supported - please use https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/languagetool/kjcoklfhicmkbfifghaecedbohbmofkm for Google Docs instead.\n\nWith LanguageTool our aim is to give users a fully-featured grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it’s also smart enough to recognize mistakes that native speakers commonly make and it will improve your writing overall. This grammar and spelling correction works across all variations of common language; distinguishing between U.S. and British English, for instance. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use but that are not found in a conventional dictionary. LanguageTool will recognize these words in future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike Grammarly (\"Grammerly\" :-) and Ginger, LanguageTool works for many languages and offers many of the same features.\n\n\nPrivacy\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to https://languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection. No account is needed to use this extension. We don't store your IP address. See our privacy policy for more details.\n\n\nWhy does LanguageTool require permission \"Access your data for all websites\"?\n\nThis permission is required to read the text you type into text fields. LanguageTool will only read the text you type into multi-line fields. Single-line fields and password fields are skipped.\n\n\nBugs\n\nPlease report bugs at https://forum.languagetool.org or at github.\n\n\nPremium Version\n\nWe offer a Premium version which is linked from several places in the add-on. This add-on also works without payment and registration, though.\n\n\nOffline Use (recommended only if you're an advanced computer user)\n\nTo use this add-on with a local server, unzip the LanguageTool desktop version from our homepage and run this command (requires Java):\n\njava -cp languagetool-server.jar org.languagetool.server.HTTPServer --allow-origin '*'\n\nThen, open the add-on configuration and set http://localhost:8081/v2 as the server URL and save the configuration. Note that the default configuration of the local server might lack some features of the server running at languagetool.org - see this comparison for details.\n\n\nOld Versions\n\nOld versions are still available at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/languagetool/versions/.","weeklyDownloads":2006,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"LanguageTooler GmbH","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/14508210/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212346.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212346.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212347.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212347.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212348.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212348.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212349.png?modified=1544977769","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212349.png?modified=1544977769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/212/212352.png?modified=1544977775","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/212/212352.png?modified=1544977775","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6541,"reviewCount":126,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/languagetool/reviews/","updateDate":1562569556000},{"id":"button@scholar.google.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/602/602626-32.png?modified=1555882942","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/602/602626-64.png?modified=1555882942","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/602/602626-128.png?modified=1555882942"},"name":"Google Scholar Button","version":"2.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/738048/google_scholar_button-2.0-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":59918,"homepageURL":"https://scholar.google.com/","supportURL":"https://support.google.com/scholar/contact/general","description":"Lookup scholarly articles as you browse the web.","fullDescription":"This extension adds a browser button for easy access to Google Scholar from any web page.

Type \"doi \" with blank space into the address bar, and BibItNow! will give you an address suggestion to open a doi link. If anything that follows \"doi \" is recognized by BibItNow as DOI, opening the suggested link will open the corresponding DOI link.\n\nNOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: Use Firefox 60 or higher for the \"autofocus option\" to work properly!\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nSo what!? Why should I care about \"BibItNow!\" ?\n\nWell, probably most scientists know the following situation: you are looking up a nice article that you want to cite, but you somehow run into troubles getting the bibliographic data from your browser into your citation library. It is often already hard to find the \"export\" button, but even if you have found it, chances are that it does not work if you use a script blocker to avoid the bazillions of unnecessary scripts that are let loose at you nowadays. And even if the export button works, the result is often useless, as it comes in an inconvenient format or contains special characters that are not compatible with your particular bibliography system of choice.\n\nBibliographic tools which are directly coupled to the browser, such as the popular tool Zotero, have already simplified this task a lot. However, the workflow of these tools is mostly optimized towards their own integrated library system, whereas many users might prefer different library tools while only caring about the citation data extraction capabilities. This plugin offers exactly that, a lightweight tool that focuses solely on extracting citation data as quickly and as correctly as possible. Click the extension's tool bar icon or press the browser action shortcut keys when surfing on the abstract page of a journal article, a book, a thesis, or on any other web page, and the extension will try everything to extract all the data you want. In the format you like, with the encoding it needs! Decide whether you want to simply copy to clipboard, download a file or open it with the program of YOUR CHOICE!\n\nNot happy? You can also contribute by visiting my github:\nhttps://github.com/Langenscheiss/bibitnow\t\n\nMain Features\n\n- Versatility: Generates bibliography items of journal articles, books, theses and generic web pages in the Bibtex, RIS, Endnote, APA, MLA or (B)Arnold S. format.\n\n- Quick workflow: No more need to mess with the publisher's export button! One click or key stroke (DEFAULT: ALT+C) to extract the data, and a second click or key stroke to copy the data to clipboard or download/open it with your favorite library software. The extension furthermore comes with a set of options purely aimed at improving your workflow. For example, the plugin automatically generates a clickable and easily copyable DOI link if a DOI is found, or any other used defined link based on the available citation data (e.g., search author on google). The plugin can also be configured to automatically highlight the citation text, enabling completely mouseless operation.\n\n- Simplicity: The plugin only extracts, formats and exports bibliographic data, and its functions are only aimed at avoiding the most common nuisances in these three steps. No fancy library system included!\n\n- Compatibility: An extensively tested set of fixed extraction and parsing rules combined with URL specific adjustments allows the plugin to work on abstract pages of many publishers, including Nature, Science, Elsevier, Springer and any publisher that cares to provide commonly formatted meta data. The extension furthermore works on journal article pages of the scientific databases PubMed and Scopus, and of the open access library arXiv. You can also cite books from various sources, such as Google books or the book section of Amazon, and news articles from any news website providing json linked data in the schema.org format.\n\n- Modifiability: Each citation format comes with a number of easily reachable and adjustable settings. Moreover, for the advanced user/contributor, the flexible data extraction and parsing system allows to easily add or improve the support for specific web pages.
